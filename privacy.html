                        <a href="support@quottie.io" class="support_link" target="_blank">support@quottie.io</a>

                        <p>Welcome to Quottie, we appreciate your interest in our app. We attach great importance to protecting your data and safeguarding your privacy. We would like to explain below which data we process, when and for what purpose and on what legal basis. </p>

                        <p>This privacy policy contains information about our data protection provisions and measures as well as the rights to which you are entitled within the framework of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with regard to the manner of online collection and use of your information. Personal data is collected exclusively in accordance with those data protection laws.</p>

                        <h2>The Controller</h2>

                        <p>The controller within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR for the processing of personal data is Quottie (Serhiy Ozhibko) of [insert address] and email [insert email]. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, as well as your rights regarding data protection, please contact us.</p>

                        <h2>Where this privacy policy applies</h2>

                        <p>This privacy policy applies to the Quottie app. When the word “we” is used, it describes the controller (us) and includes the relevant service providers that help us to make the services available to you. When designing the app, we have made sure that <i>no information that directly identifies you is collected.</i> </p>

                        <p>As however some countries including the EU have a broader definition of personal data this policy covers it. In this sense we would need to first of all explore the definition of personal data.</p>

                        <p>"Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g., cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </p>

                        <h2>Personal data that directly identifies you</h2>

                        <p>We do not collect personal data that directly identifies you such as your name or e-mail address etc. when you are using our services. In this sense, we will not ask you to provide any personal information when you are using our app.</p>

                        <h2>Installation of our app</h2>

                        <p>Our app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store. Downloading our app may require prior registration with the respective app store and installation of the app store software.
                        </p>

                        <p>App installation via the Apple App Store
                            You can use the Apple service "App Store" a service of Apple Distribution International Ltd, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill Ln, Knocknaheeney, Cork, Ireland, to install our app. As far as we are aware, Apple collects and processes the following data:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>device identifiers,</li>
                                <li>IP addresses,</li>
                                <li>location information,</li>
                            </ul> <br><br>
                            

                            <p>It cannot be excluded that Apple also transmits the information to a server in a third country. This could in particular be Apple Inc. One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California, USA, 95014. We cannot influence which personal data Apple processes with your registration and the provision of downloads in the respective app store and app store software. The responsible party in this respect is solely Apple as the operator of the Apple App Store. You can find more detailed information in Apple's privacy policy, which you can access here: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" class="link">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>. </p>

                            <h2>Log files</h2>

                            <p>When you call up our app, we automatically collect data and information from your device's system and store some of this in so-called server log files. The data is automatically transmitted by your device when you call up our app. This includes the following data:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>IP address</li>
                                <li>Date and time of your request</li>
                                <li>Time zone difference and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</li>
                                <li>Content of the request (specific page)</li>
                                <li>Access status / http status code</li>
                                <li>Amount of data transferred in each case</li>
                                <li>Website from which the request came</li>
                                <li>Browser</li>
                                <li>Operating system and its interface</li>
                                <li>Language and version of the browser software</li>
                            </ul> <br><br>

                            <p>The purpose of this processing is the retrievability of our app from your device and to enable a correct display of our app on your device or in your browser. Furthermore, we use the data to optimise our app and to ensure the security of our systems. The processing of your IP address by our system is also necessary to enable the delivery of our app to your device. An evaluation of this data for marketing purposes does not take place.</p>

                            <p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in presenting you with an app optimised for your browser and in enabling communication between our server and your terminal device. For the latter, the processing of your IP address in particular is necessary. We also collect the data to ensure stability and security for you.</p>

                            <p>The data is stored by us for 30 days. The recipient of the data is our server host, who works for us within the framework of an order data agreement.</p>

                            <h2>What data is processed when using our app?</h2>

                            <p>When you install our app, the data required for the start-up is collected and processed. This is the data that you agreed to the collection of, insofar as you have granted the corresponding authorisations to Apple. The following data is processed in the course of using our app:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>General app accesses
                                </li>
                                <li>User Generated Content</li>
                                <li>Push messages ("Message Usage")
                                </li>
                                <li>Network access (full network access, obtain internet data, retrieve network connections, retrieve WLAN connections)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>General app accesses</h2>

                            <p>As with every server request, information such as IP address, user agent etc. is transmitted and stored anonymously in the server log for 30 days. The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required, nor is it necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide the data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>

                            <h2>Push messages</h2>

                            <p>The legal basis for Push messages is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. A push service is used to provide you with useful tips and information directly on your mobile device or similar devices. When we send a push message, we send the message with the corresponding IDs or tokens to the Push Notification Service. This then ensures that the push message is sent to the devices that wish to receive such a notification. Our legitimate interest is to be able to present current information to you directly. The personal data will only be processed as long as this is necessary for the provision of the function. You have the right to object. You can prevent your data from being processed further by deactivating the push service in the respective system settings of the operating system of your device.</p>

                            <h2>Network access </h2>

                            <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. Your data will be treated confidentially by us and deleted if you revoke the rights to use it or it is no longer required to provide the services and there is no legal obligation to retain it. The provision of personal data is necessary if you wish to make full use of our app. However, failure to provide this data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent.</p>

                            <h2>Image Gallery access</h2>

                            <p>In order to change the background of quotes we require to access your image library, images, photos and 
                                other data from your camera and gallery. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) 
                                GDPR. Your image library, images, photos, and the other data accessed will be treated confidentially by us
                                and deleted if you revoke your consent. The access to image library, images, photos is necessary if you 
                                wish to change the background images of your quotes.</p>

                            <h2>Use of Google SDK / Google Firebase / Google Analytics</h2>

                            <p>We use the developer platform Google Firebase and the associated functions and services of Google LLC ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA and Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Firebase is a platform for developers of apps for mobile devices and websites.</p>

                            <p>The Google Firebase developer platform offers a variety of features. You can find a list of these at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/" class="link">https://firebase.google.com/terms/</a>.</p>

                            <p>By integrating Google services, Google may collect and process information (including personal data). It cannot be ruled out that Google also transmits the information to a server in a third country. We cannot influence what data Google actually collects and processes. However, Google states that, in principle, the following information (including personal data) may be processed, among others:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Log data (in particular the IP address)</li>
                                <li>Unique application numbers</li>
                                <li>Cookies and similar technologies</li>
                            </ul> <br><br>

                            <p>If you are logged into your Google account, Google may add the processed information to your account and treat it as personal data, depending on your account settings. You can prevent this data from being added directly by logging out of your Google account or also by making the appropriate account settings in your Google account. Furthermore, you can prevent the installation of cookies - insofar as Google sets them - by making the appropriate settings in your terminal device; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of our app to their full extent.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Firebase Firestore</h2>

Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.</p>

                            <p>By integrating Firebase Firestore, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you a better service within the scope of our app.</p>

                            <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is Art. 6 (1) f GDPR.

The use of Google Firebase Firestore gives us the opportunity to provide you with better use and information through our app.</p>

                            <p>As part of the order processing, Google is entitled to use subcontractors. A list of these subcontractors can be found at <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/" class="link">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/</a>. </p>
